# Self-hosted Maple on plain ClickHouse

Self-managed Maple can run on a vanilla ClickHouse instance — no Tinybird Cloud, no Tinybird-Local. The query engine (`@maple/query-engine`) emits standard ClickHouse SQL, and the schema is generated from the same TypeScript source the Tinybird path uses.

## Scope

This doc covers two pieces:

1. **Schema setup** — generating + applying the ClickHouse DDL on a vanilla server.
2. **Runtime configuration** — pointing the Maple API at ClickHouse instead of Tinybird.

Ingest is still bring-your-own — see [Ingest options](#ingest-options) below.

## Required ClickHouse version

Tested on ClickHouse 24.8+. Earlier versions may work but aren't validated.

## How runtime config works

Self-managed Maple is a **per-org BYO** feature. Each org configures their own backend in Settings → BYO; the credentials live in the `org_tinybird_settings` table (encrypted at rest with `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`). A `backend` column discriminates between the two flavors:

- `backend = "tinybird"` — the existing path. Maple deploys its Tinybird project into the org's workspace via the sync workflow; queries route to that workspace.
- `backend = "clickhouse"` — new. The org points Maple at a vanilla ClickHouse server they operate themselves. There is no sync workflow — schema lives in their CH instance and is applied via the CLI below.

The Maple deployment itself still uses the env-level `TINYBIRD_HOST` / `TINYBIRD_TOKEN` for any org without a BYO row. API query routing does not require new env vars for ClickHouse-BYO; D1-backed direct ingest does require `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` so the ingest gateway can decrypt stored ClickHouse passwords.

Env-level `CLICKHOUSE_URL` defaults to Tinybird's ClickHouse-compatible gateway for
compatibility with existing deployments; raw SQL substitutes a per-org JWT and
removes Tinybird-restricted query settings. For a vanilla/self-managed server, set
`CLICKHOUSE_PROVIDER=clickhouse`; Maple then preserves `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` for raw
SQL. Tinybird raw SQL also requires explicit `TINYBIRD_SIGNING_KEY` and
`TINYBIRD_WORKSPACE_ID` values; Maple never derives either from the API token.

Env-level vanilla ClickHouse raw SQL is enabled only when `MAPLE_AUTH_MODE=self_hosted`,
where the deployment is single-org. Hosted multi-org deployments fail closed unless
they use Tinybird's scoped JWT path or per-org BYO credentials.

For user-authored SQL, configure the runtime ClickHouse account as SELECT-only on the
Maple database. Apply schema migrations with a separate administrative account, and
enforce server-side limits such as maximum execution time, memory, rows, and bytes
read. Maple's client-side caps are a final response boundary, not a substitute for a
least-privilege role and server-side resource controls. See
[ClickHouse's guidance for agent-authored queries](https://clickhouse.com/blog/how-to-set-up-clickhouse-for-agentic-analytics)
for the corresponding database-side setup.

### Routing precedence

For any given query the API resolves the upstream in this order:

1. **Per-org BYO row** — if `org_tinybird_settings` has an active row for the requesting org, the row's `backend` discriminator picks Tinybird or ClickHouse, and the row's credentials drive the connection.
2. **Managed Tinybird** — fall back to `TINYBIRD_HOST` + `TINYBIRD_TOKEN`.

### Configuring ClickHouse-BYO via the UI

`Settings → BYO Backend → ClickHouse` exposes:

- **ClickHouse URL** — the HTTP interface (e.g. `https://your-clickhouse.example.com:8123`)
- **User** — defaults to `default`. Must have DDL privileges (CREATE TABLE / CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW) so the API can install the schema on save.
- **Database** — defaults to `default`
- **Password** — optional; encrypted at rest. Leave blank to keep an existing password when re-saving.

On save, the API connects to the instance, creates the schema (or skips if it already exists) inside an idempotent migration loop, and only then persists the BYO row. There is no resync flow — schema lives in your CH instance and there's nothing to push back to it.

## Applying the schema

Two ways to apply the schema. Both run the **same migrations** from `@maple/domain/clickhouse` and use the **same** [`qualifyStatementForDatabase`](../packages/domain/src/clickhouse/qualify.ts) helper, so they're interchangeable.

### Via the Maple UI (default)

`Settings → BYO Backend → ClickHouse`. On save, the API connects to the supplied URL with the supplied credentials and:

1. Creates `_maple_schema_migrations` (the bookkeeping table) if missing.
2. Applies any unapplied migrations in version order.
3. Records each applied migration's `(version, applied_at, description)`.

If the connection fails or the user lacks DDL privileges, the save returns an error and the row is **not** persisted — so an unconfigured org never gets stuck pointed at a half-migrated CH instance.

Re-saving is safe. Already-applied migrations are skipped, and every statement uses `IF NOT EXISTS` as a second line of defense. Future schema upgrades land the same way: pull a new Maple API release, then have the org re-save (or any other write to the BYO row) to pick up new migrations.

### Via the standalone CLI

For airgapped clusters, CI checks, or when your CH credentials shouldn't pass through Maple's API:

```bash
bunx @maple/clickhouse-cli@latest apply \
  --url=https://your-ch.example.com \
  --user=maple --password=$CH_PASSWORD \
  --database=default

# What's applied + what's pending
bunx @maple/clickhouse-cli@latest status

# Print DDL that would run, no execution
bunx @maple/clickhouse-cli@latest dry-run
```

Connection flags fall back to `MAPLE_CH_URL`, `MAPLE_CH_USER`, `MAPLE_CH_PASSWORD`, `MAPLE_CH_DATABASE` env vars — handy in CI. See [`packages/clickhouse-cli/README.md`](../packages/clickhouse-cli/README.md).

To inspect applied migrations directly on your CH server:

```sql
SELECT version, applied_at, description FROM _maple_schema_migrations ORDER BY version;
```

## What gets created

On a clean install, migration 0001 creates **20 tables** (datasources) and **22 materialized views**:

- **Direct-ingest tables**: `traces`, `logs`, `metrics_sum`, `metrics_gauge`, `metrics_histogram`, `metrics_exponential_histogram`, `alert_checks`
- **MV-populated tables**: `service_usage`, `service_map_spans`, `service_map_children`, `service_map_edges_hourly`, `service_overview_spans`, `error_spans`, `error_events`, `trace_list_mv`, `trace_detail_spans`, `attribute_keys_hourly`, `attribute_values_hourly`, `traces_aggregates_hourly`, `logs_aggregates_hourly`
- **Materialized views**: 22 MVs that fan out from the direct-ingest tables to populate the MV-populated tables

Every table is partitioned by date and carries a 90-day TTL (365 days on metrics) — adjust by writing a follow-up migration if your retention requirements differ.

## Ingest options

The maintained standalone path is **Option A: Maple's prebuilt OTel Collector image** (`mapleexporter` baked in). Hosted/self-hosted Maple deployments can also use the Rust ingest gateway's direct ClickHouse path once an org is marked ready. Three escape hatches stay supported for advanced setups.

### Maple ingest gateway direct ClickHouse path

For orgs whose `org_clickhouse_settings` row has `sync_status = 'connected'` and `schema_version` equal to the bundled `clickHouseSchemaVersion` (the latest ClickHouse **migration version** — emitted into the gateway as `SCHEMA_VERSION` by `scripts/generate-clickhouse-insert-mappings.ts`), the Rust ingest gateway routes accepted native-ingest frames directly to that org's ClickHouse HTTP endpoint. Non-ready orgs continue using the managed Tinybird path. Readiness keys on the migration version — **not** the Tinybird-coupled `clickHouseProjectRevision` — so a Tinybird-only schema change can't un-ready a BYO-ClickHouse org whose ClickHouse DDL is unchanged.

D1-backed ingest deployments must set `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` before rolling out this mode; the gateway exits at startup without it because ClickHouse passwords are encrypted at rest with the same AES-256-GCM key format as private ingest keys.

Operational caveats:

- **Readiness keys on the migration version, which only the API marks.** The `schema_version` stored in D1 is written to `clickHouseSchemaVersion` **only** by the API's `applySchema` workflow (or by `schemaDiff` self-heal, below). A credential re-save _preserves_ the prior value, and the standalone `clickhouse-cli` writes `_maple_schema_migrations` **on your CH server but never touches D1**. So an org whose ClickHouse schema was applied entirely via the CLI stays `schema_version`-stale and the gateway keeps routing to Tinybird, even though the cluster is fully migrated. Symptom: the dashboard (which reads CH whenever a settings row exists) shows collector-written data, but data sent through the public ingestor is invisible because it landed in Tinybird. (Before the migration-version cutover, a Tinybird-only change also tripped this; keying on the migration version removes that class of false-stale.)
- **Self-heal:** calling `schemaDiff` (e.g. opening `Settings → BYO Backend → ClickHouse`, or `POST /orgClickHouseSettings/schemaDiff`) re-stamps `schema_version` to `clickHouseSchemaVersion` whenever the live schema is fully in sync (every diff entry `up_to_date`). This is the supported way to mark a CLI-applied org ready without forcing an Apply that has nothing to migrate. The read path also annotates a `clickhouse.schemaDrift` span attribute (`OrgClickHouseSettingsService.resolveRuntimeConfig`) — alert on it to catch stale orgs.
- ClickHouse-routed frames never fall back to Tinybird. After the configured export retry budget is exhausted, the batch is dropped, the WAL cursor advances, and `ingest_clickhouse_export_dropped_total` records the datasource and final drop reason. Alert on any non-zero increase in that counter.
- Password-authenticated ClickHouse endpoints must use `https://`; the gateway drops passworded `http://` targets before attaching `X-ClickHouse-Key`.
- Direct ClickHouse routing writes WAL v3 frames. Do not roll back to a pre-direct-ClickHouse ingest binary while v3 frames may remain in the queue; first drain the WAL, or accept that clearing the queue directory is a data-loss recovery step.

### Option A — Maple OTel Collector (recommended)

A custom build of `otelcol-contrib` with the `mapleexporter` baked in. The exporter writes JSON-each-row directly into Maple's `traces` / `logs` / `metrics_*` tables, no shim required.

- **Image:** `ghcr.io/makisuo/maple/otel-collector-maple` (multi-arch — amd64 + arm64). Pin a tag (e.g. `0.1.5`); see [the package page](https://github.com/users/makisuo/packages/container/package/maple%2Fotel-collector-maple) for available versions.
- **Source:** [`packages/otel-collector-maple-exporter/`](../packages/otel-collector-maple-exporter/) — builder config in [`deploy/k8s-infra/builder-config.yaml`](../deploy/k8s-infra/builder-config.yaml), Dockerfile in [`deploy/k8s-infra/Dockerfile.otel-collector-maple`](../deploy/k8s-infra/Dockerfile.otel-collector-maple).

#### Step 1: apply the schema

Use the standalone CLI — no Maple API required, and your CH credentials never leave the machine running it:

```bash
bunx @maple/clickhouse-cli@latest apply \
  --url=https://your-ch.example.com \
  --user=maple --password=$CH_PASSWORD \
  --database=default
```

Or save credentials in the Maple UI under `Settings → BYO Backend → ClickHouse` and the API will run the same migrations on your behalf.

#### Step 2: deploy the collector

**Kubernetes** — install the [`maple-otel`](../deploy/maple-otel/) Helm chart:

```bash
helm install maple-otel oci://ghcr.io/makisuo/charts/maple-otel \
  --namespace maple --create-namespace \
  --set maple.orgId=org_xxx \
  --set maple.clickhouse.endpoint=https://your-ch.example.com \
  --set maple.clickhouse.password.value=$CH_PASSWORD
```

Apps then point `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at `http://maple-otel.maple.svc.cluster.local:4318`.

**Anywhere else (Docker / VM / ECS / Nomad / …)** — download a pre-rendered config from Maple:

1. `Settings → BYO Backend → ClickHouse → Download collector config` (or `GET /api/org-clickhouse-settings/collector-config`).
2. Drop the YAML next to a copy of the image and run:

    ```bash
    docker run \
      -e MAPLE_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=$CH_PASSWORD \
      -v ./collector.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml \
      -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 \
      ghcr.io/makisuo/maple/otel-collector-maple:0.1.5
    ```

The rendered YAML carries your `org_id`, ClickHouse URL/user/database, and the standard memory_limiter → k8sattributes → batch → maple pipeline. The password is referenced via `${env:MAPLE_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD}` so the file is safe to share.

#### Org id resolution

The `mapleexporter` stamps `OrgId` from its own `org_id` config on every record — no upstream `resource/maple_org` processor required for the typical single-tenant deploy. For multi-tenant fan-out (one collector serving several Maple orgs) set `org_id_from_resource_attribute: maple_org_id` on the exporter and stamp the right id per-record upstream; see [`packages/otel-collector-maple-exporter/README.md`](../packages/otel-collector-maple-exporter/README.md).

### Option B — Tinybird exporter + a shim service

The original "drop-in for Tinybird Cloud users" path. Run otelcol-contrib's `tinybird` exporter and point it at a small shim that:

- Accepts `POST /v0/events?name=<datasource>` with NDJSON bodies.
- Applies the JSONPath mappings from `packages/domain/src/tinybird/datasources.ts` to project each row into the right column shape.
- Issues `INSERT INTO <datasource> FORMAT JSONEachRow` against ClickHouse.

The shim is not in this repo — operators write or fork their own. The JSONPath spec required to drive it is exposed via `emitJsonPathSpec()` in `@maple/domain/clickhouse`.

### Option C — Tinybird-Local

If you're not allergic to running another container, [tinybird-local](https://github.com/tinybirdco/tinybird-local) is a single-binary Tinybird-API-compatible local server backed by ClickHouse. The Tinybird exporter works against it unchanged. Heavier than Option A but useful when you want Tinybird's UI side-by-side.

### Option D — Direct INSERTs from your application

If you have a small, well-defined ingest path (e.g. you control the SDK that emits to Maple), nothing stops you from `INSERT INTO traces FORMAT JSONEachRow` directly. The JSONPath spec defines what shape the rows should be in. Each row should look like the Tinybird exporter's output — see the `$.…` paths in `datasources.ts`.

## Schema source of truth

Schema lives in `packages/domain/src/tinybird/datasources.ts` and `materializations.ts`. These TypeScript files are consumed by **two** emitters:

- The Tinybird manifest emitter (existing) — produces `.datasource` / `.pipe` files for Tinybird Cloud
- The ClickHouse DDL emitter (new) — produces `CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements

To regenerate the ClickHouse schema after a TS change:

```bash
bun run clickhouse:schema
```

CI checks this stays in sync via `bun run clickhouse:schema:check`.

## Extending the schema

To add a new column, table, or materialized view:

1. Edit `packages/domain/src/tinybird/datasources.ts` or `materializations.ts`.
2. Run `bun run clickhouse:schema` to regenerate the snapshot.
3. Create a new file `packages/domain/src/clickhouse/migrations/0002_<descriptive_name>.ts`:

    ```typescript
    export const migration_0002_add_foo_column = {
    	version: 2,
    	description: "Add Foo column to traces",
    	statements: [
    		"ALTER TABLE traces ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS Foo String DEFAULT ''",
    		// For columns with non-trivial DEFAULT expressions that need backfilling:
    		"ALTER TABLE traces MATERIALIZE COLUMN Foo",
    	],
    } as const
    ```

4. Append it to the `migrations` array in `packages/domain/src/clickhouse/migrations/index.ts`.

The next `clickhouse:schema:apply` will pick it up and run only the new migration.

### Replacing Tinybird's `forwardQuery`

A handful of datasources use Tinybird's `forwardQuery` block to backfill computed columns when the schema evolves (e.g. `traces.SampleRate`, `traces.IsEntryPoint`). For self-hosted ClickHouse, the equivalent pattern is paired statements:

```sql
ALTER TABLE traces ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS NewCol Type DEFAULT <expr>;
ALTER TABLE traces MATERIALIZE COLUMN NewCol;
```

`MATERIALIZE COLUMN` runs as a background mutation and populates existing rows using the `DEFAULT` expression. For per-row, idempotent expressions (the only kind currently in use) this is functionally equivalent to Tinybird's `forwardQuery`.

## Migrating from Tinybird-Local

Clean break is recommended — Maple's data has a 90-day TTL by default, so most operators can:

1. Stop your ingest path.
2. Bring up the new vanilla-ClickHouse stack and apply the schema.
3. Resume ingest. Old data ages out within 90 days.

If you need historical data preserved, Tinybird-Local exposes its underlying ClickHouse on port 7181, so a one-shot `INSERT INTO new.<table> SELECT * FROM tinybird_local.<table>` over `remote()` is feasible. This isn't currently shipped as tooling.

## Troubleshooting

- **Save fails with "ClickHouse rejected credentials"**: the user/password combo doesn't authenticate. Maple maps CH 401/403 responses to this error.
- **Save fails with "ClickHouse rejected statement"**: the configured user authenticates but lacks DDL privileges, or a migration ran into a CH-version-specific syntax issue. Check `system.query_log` on your CH server for the failing statement.
- **Save fails with "Could not reach ClickHouse"**: the API can't make an HTTP request to the URL. Network/DNS/firewall — verify the API can reach the URL.
- **Migration appears to hang on `MATERIALIZE COLUMN`**: this is a background mutation. Watch `system.mutations` to see progress.
- **`schema:check` fails in CI but the diff looks empty**: someone changed `datasources.ts` without running `bun run clickhouse:schema`. Run it locally and commit the regenerated file.
