## Architecture

Maple consists of the following components:

| Component | Default Port | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ingest Gateway** | `3474` | Receives OTLP telemetry, authenticates requests, and forwards to the collector |
| **OTel Collector** | `4317` (gRPC), `4318` (HTTP) | Processes and exports telemetry to Tinybird |
| **Dashboard** | `3471` | Web UI for exploring traces, logs, and metrics |
| **API** | `3472` | Backend API for the dashboard |

Your services send telemetry to the **Ingest Gateway** (port `3474`), not directly to the collector.

## Ingest Endpoints

The ingest gateway exposes standard OTLP/HTTP endpoints:

| Endpoint | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| `POST /v1/traces` | Traces (spans) |
| `POST /v1/logs` | Logs |
| `POST /v1/metrics` | Metrics |

## Authentication

Every request to the ingest gateway must include an ingest key. You can pass it in one of two ways:

```bash
# Option 1: Authorization header (recommended)
Authorization: Bearer maple_pk_your_key_here

# Option 2: Custom header
x-maple-ingest-key: maple_pk_your_key_here
```

Ingest keys are created in the Maple dashboard under **Settings**. Keys use the prefix `maple_pk_` (public) or `maple_sk_` (private).

## Supported Formats

The gateway accepts the following content types:

- **Protobuf** (default) — `application/x-protobuf`
- **JSON** — `application/json`
- **gzip** — Set `Content-Encoding: gzip` to send compressed payloads
