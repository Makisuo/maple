Maple accepts standard [OTLP/HTTP](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/) telemetry, which means **any OpenTelemetry SDK** can send data to it. You just need to configure the OTLP exporter to point at your Maple ingest gateway.

The general pattern for any language is:

1. Install the OpenTelemetry SDK and OTLP exporter for your language
2. Set the exporter endpoint to your Maple ingest gateway (`http://localhost:3474`)
3. Add the authorization header with your ingest key
4. Run your app

- **Python** — Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Go** — net/http, gRPC, Gin
- **Java** — Spring Boot, Quarkus
- **Rust** — tracing + opentelemetry crate

## Generic OTLP Configuration

For any language, you can configure the standard OpenTelemetry environment variables:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:3474"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer maple_pk_your_key_here"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL="http/protobuf"
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="my-service"
```

Most OpenTelemetry SDKs will pick these up automatically.
