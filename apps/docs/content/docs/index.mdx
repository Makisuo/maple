Maple is an open-source observability platform built on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). It collects traces, logs, and metrics from your services via standard OTLP and gives you a real-time dashboard to understand what's happening in your system.

## How it works

```
Your Service          Ingest Gateway          OTel Collector          Tinybird          Dashboard
   │                      │                       │                    │                  │
   ├─── OTLP/HTTP ───────►│                       │                    │                  │

   │                      │                       │                    ├─── query ────────►│

1. **Instrument** your app with any OpenTelemetry SDK
2. **Send** telemetry to Maple's ingest gateway over OTLP/HTTP
3. **Store** data in Tinybird via the OpenTelemetry Collector
4. **Visualize** traces, logs, and metrics in the Maple dashboard
